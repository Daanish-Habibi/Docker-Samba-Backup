# Docker-Samba-Storage

# Samba Backup Watcher

A lightweight, low-power home storage solution built with Docker. This project provides:
- A cross-platform **Samba file server** for Android, iOS, and desktop access
- An **automated backup system** that watches for new or changed files and syncs them to an optional second drive (e.g., M.2 SSD)

Designed for always-on, low-resource environments (like repurposed desktops or mini PCs), this setup helps you manage local storage without the cloud â€” while optionally backing up files in near real-time.

# Docker-Samba-Storage

A lightweight, low-power home storage solution built with Docker. This project provides:
- A cross-platform **Samba file server** for Android, iOS, and desktop access
- An **automated backup system** that watches for new or changed files and syncs them to an optional second drive (e.g., M.2 SSD)

Designed for always-on, low-resource environments (like repurposed desktops or mini PCs), this setup helps you manage local storage without the cloud â€” while optionally backing up files in near real-time.

## Instructions

- **Modify the following files to include the proper user information:**

  #### `config.txt`

  - **Basic idea for `-u`** â†’ `user_name;password`
    - Sets up a Samba user with username and password

  - **Basic idea for `-s`** â†’ `share_name;path;browseable;readonly;guest;user_list`
    - `share_name` â€” name of the shared folder (what shows on the network)
    - `path` â€” the path to the folder you want to share
    - `browseable` â€” `yes` or `no`; whether it appears in network folder list
    - `readonly` â€” `yes` (read-only) or `no` (read/write)
    - `guest` â€” `yes` allows access with no login; `no` requires user
    - `user_list` â€” comma-separated usernames (must match ones defined with `-u`)

- **Run the stack** (remove `all` if you donâ€™t need the backup sync service):

  ```bash
  bash start.sh all
